# Generalizing Danish NER to Emerging and Linguistically Distant Named Entities

A project investigating bias in Danish NER models and exploring data augmentation strategies to improve performance on underrepresented entities.

## Description

This project analyzes the ability of Danish NER models to generalize to unseen named entities of Middle Eastern origin. We examine bias by comparing the performance of a model trained on Danish data across two Danish test sets containing emerging entities, one of which consists of Middle Eastern names. Through data augmentation, we aim to improve model robustness without degrading performance on the original Danish entities. We evaluate span-F1 scores across different setups and types of entities.
